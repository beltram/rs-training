## sections

* We can use specific markdown heading to create sections
* Sections are used to discuss particular scenarios or edge case

```rust
/// # Example // often used to write code
/// # Panics // often used to give an example where it panics
/// # Errors // used to discuss about the errors when returning a result
/// # Safety // used to discuss about unsafe code and why there is some
```

* See an display example [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html#making-useful-documentation-comments) for the example section
