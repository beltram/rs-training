## snippet 

* You can write code in your comments, it will be compiled and run by default
* The code will act as test using `cargo test`
* Use markdown to declare code blocks

```rust
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// let x = 5;
/// ``` ```

* rust can be omitted, by default rustdoc uses ` ```rust ` when you use ` ``` `
