## Go for casuals

```
The key point here is our programmers are Googlers, they’re not researchers.
They’re typically, fairly young, fresh out of school,
probably learned Java, maybe learned C or C++, probably learned Python.
They’re not capable of understanding a brilliant language
but we want to use them to build good software.
So, the language that we give them has to be easy
for them to understand and easy to adopt.
