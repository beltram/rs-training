## orphan rule

* The `overlap rules`: You can't write two impl blocks that "overlap", i.e. apply to some of the same types. 
    - For example, `impl<T: Debug>` Trait for T overlaps with `impl<T: Display>` Trait for T because some types might implement both
* The `orphan rules` forbid you from writing an impl where both the trait and the type are defined in a different crate.
	- Prevent dependency problem where multiple crates write conflicting impls on the same type (meaning we can't use both crates in the same project)
	- Allow crates to add impls for their traits and types without it being considered a breaking change
