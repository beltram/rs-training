[Why ?](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/web-development/articles/why-webassembly-and-rust-together-improve-nodejs-performance/)
* Low level control with reliable performance
* No Garbage collector

* Do not rewrite everything
* Good interaction with existing tooling
* Huge webassembly ecosystem [WebAssemblyHub online](https://webassemblyhub.io/)
