## Unsafe

Unsafe is like telling the compiler: "I'm a big boy I know what I'm doing and you can't !"  
Using unsafe allows to:

* Dereference a raw pointer
* Call an unsafe function or method
* Access or modify a mutable static variable
* Implement an unsafe trait
* Access fields of unions
