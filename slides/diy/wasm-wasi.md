## WebAssembly & WASI

* `WebAssembly (WASM):` Portable bytecode format for executing code written in [multiple language](https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs) at near-native speed. Fourth standard language of the web (Html, CSS and JS) to run natively in all the major browsers. Can be run across a variety of different machine architectures.
The runtime is memory-safe and sandboxed for security.

* `WASI` WebAssembly System Interface to execute wasm inside and outside the web.
