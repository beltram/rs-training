## serde

* a crate/framework used to serialize & deserialize data structures
* data formats implemented by the community: JSON, YAML, TOML, Avro ...
* data structure knows how to serialize and deserialize itself (thanks to derive macros)
* serialization and deserialization tools are automatically generated at compile time
