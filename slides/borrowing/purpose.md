## Purpose

* Safety
    * no manual memory management to avoid errors
    * compile time linting
* Speed
    * stack allocation by default
    * no garbage collector
    * scoped lifetime to avoid "stop-the-world" garbage collection

---
* Understand [the stack and the Heap](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.17.0/book/the-stack-and-the-heap.html)
