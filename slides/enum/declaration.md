## declaration

* Different from enums in jvm languages
* An enum is a type in itself (pretty similar to struct declaration)
* UpperCamelCase name of variants

```rust
enum City {
    Nantes, // comma separated declaration (just like struct)
    Annecy,
    Juarez(String), // each variant can have associated data
    Paris { district: u8 }, // data can be named explicitely
}
```
